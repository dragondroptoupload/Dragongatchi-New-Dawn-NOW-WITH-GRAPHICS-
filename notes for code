#1 PRIORITY: FIX THE SPECIES SELECTION SO IT PROPERLY LOOPS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ideas for such a thing: move species selection to individual script?


talk function

male/female dragon choice. could take some time to implement, would have to edit some text strings. 1/2 way finished. need to add the text string variable.

personality function?


saving, eventually. unknown if possible on replit/unknown if possible in general.

if stats/inventory are checked while inventory is empty, crash occurs, fix this.
